  "description" : "In this two-hour, project-based course, we introduce Unity's powerful animation tool. You'll learn about different animations and effects that you can apply to pick-up objects to make them more noticeable and give your game a more polished look. This project covers recording and playing simple animations, basic customization of particle effects, and playing the particle effects when certain events occur in your game.\n\nThe guided project will introduce you to the following Unity concepts:\n- Animations\n- Particle Effects\n- Triggers\n- Coding techniques such as OnTrigger events and invoking methods\n\nThis is a stand-alone guided project, but is also Part 1 in a two-part series introducing Unity's animation features. Part 2 will cover using the Animation Window to create trigger transitions between multiple animations on a single GameObject.\n\nThis guided project and series also serve as an optional but recommended foundation for the \"FPS Weapon\" series.\n\nThis project makes use of the camera movement script written in Create Keyboard Movement Mechanics with C# in Unity and the concepts introduced in Create Power-Ups and Obstacles with C# in Unity. These compliment this guided project and, although not prerequisites, are recommended for a more well-rounded understanding of the concepts presented herein.",

For example, a hash table provides immediate access to data indexed by an arbitrary key value, that could be a number (such as a memory address for cached memory), a URL (such as for a web cache) or a dictionary. Graphs are used to represent relationships between items, and this course covers several different data structures for representing graphs and several different algorithms for traversing graphs, including finding the shortest route from one node to another node. These graph algorithms will also depend on another concept called disjoint sets, so this course will also cover its data structure and associated algorithms.",

  "description" : "In this 2-hour long project-based course, you will learn how to retrieve data from tables in a database using SQL SELECT statement with SQL Aggregate functions. The aggregate functions we will consider in this project are COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX and AVG. Aggregate functions are used to summarize data from rows of a table into a single value. In addition, you will learn how to set conditions on the output of an aggregate function using the HAVING clause. Finally, you will learn how to tidy up the result set of aggregate functions using the ROUND function.\n\nNote: You do not need to be a data administrator or data analyst to be successful in this guided project, just a familiarity with querying databases using SQL SELECT statement suffice for this project. If you are not familiar with SQL and want to learn the basics, start with my previous guided projects titled “Performing Data definition and Manipulation in SQL.\"  and “Querying Databases using SQL SELECT statement”",

  "description" : "How are international power relations changing and how can global peace and stability be maintained? This course familiarizes you with some main theories of international relations, shows how the global order is gradually changing and discusses how selected international and regional organizations contribute to the maintenance of global peace and security. You learn what research findings tell us in terms of the capacity of international organizations and actors to help prevent or stop violent conflict, what tools are used to negotiate agreements and how foundations for sustainable peace are best created. We will also focus on the role of the European Union in terms of diplomacy and efforts to prevent conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the contribution of organizations such as the African Union to the prevention of conflict and war. We will study the United Nations Security Council and see in which ways its membership could be adapted to more accurately reflect the power relations of the current global order. Through quizzes and exercises testing your knowledge of these subjects, you will understand crucial concepts and get insights into how the academic study of international relations and international organization contributes to the search for global stability and peace in practice.",

  "description" : "This is a course aimed at making you a better designer. The course marries theory and practice, as both are valuable in improving design performance. Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity. Weekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis of the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior sessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also be a peer reviewer. This format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while getting useful feedback on your own project.",

  "description" : "This course is for early career researchers and mentors who believe that modern scientific careers require management skills and want to be research leaders. This curriculum gives you skills to effectively implement funded projects, thereby enhancing your career success. Research leaders take on a number of new roles, rights, and responsibilities--as scientific leaders, financial administrators, managers, and mentors. In this course, we explain how to optimize the people, teams, projects, and finances for which you are responsible. \n\nDespite your research training, you are probably facing an urgent training gap in leadership and management skills. Scientific careers falter for non-science reasons when researchers fail to execute a scope of work: struggle to track expenses and returns substantial unspent grant funds; or run out of funds by spending on the wrong people or mismanaging the right people. Consequently, projects close with inadequate progress on aims, thus compromising successful competition for future funding. This course will help avoid these traps.\n\nLeadership and management are essential skills for researchers. Several early career researchers, senior scientists, and administrative leaders are eager to share their expertise and experiences with you.",

You will learn about configuration space (C-space), degrees of freedom, C-space topology, implicit and explicit representations of configurations, and holonomic and nonholonomic constraints.  You will also learn how to represent spatial velocities and forces as twists and wrenches.  This material is at the core of the study of anything that moves (e.g., robots).\n\nThis course follows the textbook \"Modern Robotics:  Mechanics, Planning, and Control\" (Lynch and Park, Cambridge University Press 2017).  You can purchase the book or use the free preprint pdf.  You will build on a library of robotics software in the language of your choice (among Python, Mathematica, and MATLAB) and use the free cross-platform robot simulator V-REP, which allows you to work with state-of-the-art robots in the comfort of your own home and with zero financial investment.",

  "description" : "Large-scale biology projects such as the sequencing of the human genome and gene expression surveys using RNA-seq, microarrays and other technologies have created a wealth of data for biologists. However, the challenge facing scientists is analyzing and even accessing these data to extract useful information pertaining to the system being studied. This course focuses on employing existing bioinformatic resources – mainly web-based programs and databases – to access the wealth of data to answer questions relevant to the average biologist, and is highly hands-on. \n\nTopics covered include multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, gene expression data analysis, and protein interaction networks, in two separate parts. \n\nThe first part, Bioinformatic Methods I (this one), deals with databases, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, selection analysis and metagenomics. \n\nThe second part, Bioinformatic Methods II, covers motif searching, protein-protein interactions, structural bioinformatics, gene expression data analysis, and cis-element predictions. \n\nThis pair of courses is useful to any student considering graduate school in the biological sciences, as well as students considering molecular medicine. Both provide an overview of the many different bioinformatic tools that are out there. \n\nThese courses are based on one taught at the University of Toronto to upper-level undergraduates who have some understanding of basic molecular biology. If you're not familiar with this, something like https://learn.saylor.org/course/bio101 might be helpful. No programming is required for this course. \n\nBioinformatic Methods I is regularly updated, and was completely updated for January 2020.",

  "description" : "This course is designed to quite literally ‘make a science’ out of something at the heart of society: social networks. Humans are natural network scientists, as we compute new network configurations all the time, almost unaware, when thinking about friends and family (which are particular forms of social networks), about colleagues and organizational relations (other, overlapping network structures), and about how to navigate delicate or opportunistic network configurations to save guard or advance in our social standing (with society being one big social network itself). While such network structures always existed, computational social science has helped to reveal and to study them more systematically. In the first part of the course we focus on network structure. This looks as static snapshots of networks, which can be intricate and reveal important aspects of social systems. In our hands-on lab, you will also visualize and analyze a network with a software yourself, which will help to appreciate the complexity social networks can take on. During the second part of the course, we will look at how networks evolve in time. We ask how we can predict what kind of network will form and if and how we could influence network dynamics.",

  "description" : "Each part of the world faces specific vulnerabilities to climate change and has different opportunities to mitigate the effects and build resilience in the 21st century. With the ratification of the Paris Agreement, many countries have acceded to act in combatting climate change. Indeed, without climate action, decades of sustainable development is at risk, thus making this a ‘make or break’ point in time. Showcasing the most recent scientific evidence, explaining the different regional impacts and divulging climate action strategies, along with interactive tools such as a Carbon Footprint Tracker and (I) NDC Platform, this MOOC provides some opportunities, where you can take action on climate change.\n\nAbout the Course\n\nThis action-oriented MOOC gives you the opportunity to learn about regional climate change impacts and sector-specific strategies to increase resilience and move towards a low-carbon future. You will have the opportunity to explore these issues in depth and tailor your learning experience for one or more of the following regions:\n\n•  Latin America and Caribbean\n•  Sub-Saharan Africa\n•  Middle East and North Africa\n•  Eastern Europe and Central Asia\n•  East Asia and Pacific\n•  South Asia\n\n In this endeavor, the MOOC brings together renowned scientists and policymakers to provide a synthesis of the most recent scientific evidence on climate change, regional low emissions and climate resilient development strategies across sectors. A team of expert Instructors will lead discussions around the Paris Agreement, reflections from COP22 and the progress on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).\n\nCourse Syllabus\n\nOverview \n\n‘From Climate Science to Action’ is divided into four weeks. The first two weeks will provide a comprehensive overview of the scientific evidence for climate change, followed by region-specific insights on the impacts of a warmer world in the 21st century. The last two weeks will focus on action strategies that are being undertaken in different regions and countries to meet the climate challenge, and how you as an individual can take action to avoid a warmer world!\n\nWeek 1:  Climate Change in the 21st Century\n\n•  Historical and projected observed changes in the climate system, leading up to the end of the 21st century\n•  The potential of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted at COP 21 from 187 countries to induce climate action\n•  Trends in climate change impacts, including loss of Arctic sea ice, melting glaciers, increased heat waves and extreme temperatures, and drought and aridity \n•  Possible responses from natural systems, explaining how warming could result in sea-level rise, heat waves and extreme temperatures, and ocean acidification\n\nWeek 2: Sectoral and Regional Impacts\n\n•  Impacts on key development sectors—from warming above pre-industrial temperatures and projected climate trends—across each of the world’s regions\n•  Sectoral impacts focusing on agricultural production, water resources, ecosystem services, and coastal vulnerability for affected populations \n•  Importance of risks with the potential to reverse hard-won development gains and potentially trap millions in poverty, illustrating the need for urgent action now\n\nWeek 3: From Science to Action on Climate Change\n\n•  Region-specific discussions on mitigation actions needed to reduce emissions while decreasing vulnerability to climate change impacts through adaptation and by building climate resilience\n•  Perspectives from regional experts on their experiences in strategies and actions proposed in each region to help transition towards a low-emissions, climate-resilient development path \n•  Discussions on the progress of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), outcomes of the Paris Agreement and reflections from the Conference of Parties (COP)22\n\nWeek 4: What You Can Do\n\n•  Transformative impact of day-to-day changes when brought to a global scale\n•  The rationale for acting now, acting together and acting differently\n•  Examples and expected benefits of mitigation and adaptation policies, considering both contributions to global emission reductions and local development opportunities\n\nIn addition to the core resources and assignments, you may choose to go further, engaging in fun optional exercises, networking, discussion, and diving deeper into our rich selection of supplemental resources. You will have the opportunity to explore these issues in depth and tailor your learning experience for one or more of the following regions:\n\n•  Latin America and Caribbean\n•  Sub-Saharan Africa\n•  Middle East and North Africa\n•  Eastern Europe and Central Asia\n•  East Asia and Pacific\n•  South Asia\n\nCourse Format\n\nThis MOOC has a week-by-week structure, with resources, activities and exercises for you to engage in during each of the four weeks of the course. Each week, you will find a variety of course material, including: \n\n•  Interactive video talks by renowned climate scientists and practitioners \n•  Interactive tools: the Carbon Footprint Tracker, (I) NDC platform\n•  Resources: Core, optional (deep dive) and fun interactives on the week’s theme\n•  Quizzes that check your knowledge, reinforce the lesson’s material and provide immediate feedback\n•  Assignments that will sharpen your skills of analysis, reflection and communication\n•  Discussion forums and social media that enable collaboration with others from around the world, enriching interaction among participants\n•  As a final project, you will create a digital artifact \n\nYou can also go much further than this, engaging in optional exercises, networking, or discussion forums and dive deeper into our rich selection of additional resources. We also will use e-discussions, and other tools to facilitate dialogue between the learners and experts.\n\nRecommended Background: No background knowledge is necessary. The content of this course is designed to be accessible to students from any discipline.\n\nConnect: Communicate and share resources via Twitter using hashtag #learnclimate.

  "description" : "Welcome to this project-based course on Analyzing Box Office Data with Seaborn and Python. In this course, you will be working with the The Movie Database (TMDB) Box Office Prediction data set. The motion picture industry is raking in more revenue than ever with its expansive growth the world over. Can we build models to accurately predict movie revenue? Could the results from these models be used to further increase revenue? We try to answer these questions by way of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in this project and the next. The statistical data visualization libraries Seaborn and Plotly will be our workhorses to generate interactive, publication-quality graphs. By the end of this course, you will be able to produce data visualizations in Python with Seaborn, and apply graphical techniques used in exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n\nThis course runs on Coursera's hands-on project platform called Rhyme. On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops containing all of the software and data you need for the project. Everything is already set up directly in your internet browser so you can just focus on learning. For this project, you’ll get instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, and scikit-learn pre-installed.\n\nNotes:\n-  You will be able to access the cloud desktop 5 times. However, you will be able to access instructions videos as many times as you want.\n- This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",

  "description" : "Few kinds of communication can have the effect of a powerful presentation.  Even a short speech can motivate people to change long-held beliefs or to take action, and a wonderfully delivered speech can transform a normal person into a leader.\n\nIn this course, Prof. William Kuskin provides a series of pragmatic videos and exercises for successful public speaking and presentations. The course develops through four themes—mastering fear, developing a creative formula, using verbal and body language, and anticipating the room—so that you can discover your personal power as a speaker and give excellent presentations.  \n\nSuccessful presentations do not rely on perfect teeth, a deep voice, or an army of scriptwriters.  They depend largely on the same skills as successful Business Writing and Graphic Design: clarity, structure, and revision. The goal of the course, therefore, is to enable you to discover your own internal power as a speaker and express it to the world.  After this course, with some practice, you will be able to go into any situation and command the room for as long as you like. ",

  "description" : "In contemporary societies healthcare is a key social institute that addresses the issues of maintenance and improvement of citizens’ health. While population health is largely produced outside of healthcare settings themselves, the functioning of healthcare, including diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness, injury, and other impairments, is essential for people’s wellbeing. Yet, healthcare can be and often is insufficiently accessible, responsive, and efficient for different members of society. How can healthcare provision and society be bridged?\nThrough the exploration of a combination of theoretical and practical perspectives, this online course highlights the necessity of a dialogue and collaboration between healthcare professionals, patients, and the public at large. Course participants will critically explore challenges posed by disjunctures between healthcare and society, analyze both benefits and unintended consequences of bridging the two, and propose ways to accomplish the bridging in practice of healthcare provision.\n\nAfter completion of this course you will be able to:\n\n1.\tRecognize disjunctures between healthcare provision and society\n2.\tBe aware of consequences of disjunctures between healthcare provision and society\n3.\tIdentify opportunities for bridging healthcare provision and society, using a biosocial approach to health\n4.\tAnalyze cases of disjunctures between healthcare provision and society, and propose opportunities for bridging\n5.\tRecognize the historical trends of scientification, professionalization, and medicalization, in the relations between medicine, health care, and society.\n\nThis course was developed by a consortium of five universities: Maastricht University, National Research Tomsk State University, National University of \"Kyiv-Mohyla Academy\",  National Pirogov Memorial Medical University, Vinnytsya, and Siberian State Medical University within the framework of BIHSENA project. BIHSENA stands for “Bridging Innovations, Health and Societies: Educational capacity building in the Eastern European Neighbouring Areas”.

It is important to consider basic relationships between models and data, so, using the basic SIR model you have developed in course 1, you will calibrate this model to epidemic data. Performing such a calibration by hand will help you gain an understanding of how model parameters can be adjusted in order to capture real-world data. Lastly in this course, you will learn about two simple approaches to computer-based model calibration - the least-squares approach and the maximum-likelihood approach; you will perform model calibrations under each of these approaches in R.",

  "description" : "How can we shape urban development towards sustainable and prosperous futures?\n\nThis course will explore sustainable cities as engines for greening the economy. We place cities in the context of sustainable urban transformation and climate change. Sustainable urban transformation refers to structural transformation processes – multi-dimensional and radical change – that can effectively direct urban development towards ambitious sustainability and climate goals.\n\nWe will connect the key trends of urbanization, decarbonisation and sustainability. We will examine visions, experiments and innovations in urban areas. We will look at practices (what is happening in cities at present) and opportunities (what are the possibilities for cities going forwards into the future). We bring together a collection of diverse short films and key short readings on sustainable cities as well as interactive forums and a practical assignment to create an online learning community.\n\nThis course provides key examples of activities to promote sustainable cities in Scandinavia, Europe and around the world. We utilize films and reports by WWF, the Economist Intelligence Unit, ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, UN-Habitat, C40 Climate Leadership Group, Arup, Sustainia, the Rockefeller Foundation, and ongoing research projects. This course is produced by Lund University in cooperation with WWF and ICLEI. It is available for free to everyone, everywhere!\n\nThe International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) at Lund University is an international centre of excellence on sustainable solutions. The IIIEE is ideally suited to understand and explain the interdisciplinary issues in sustainable cities and greening the economy utilising the diverse disciplinary backgrounds of its international staff.

You identify opportunities in your daily life to increase the wellbeing by using knowledge you developed in the first four courses of the Specialization. In this final project, you evaluate the efficacy of a positive intervention based on subjective and objective measures. Then, you compare how empirical and non-empirically-based positive interventions can be applied to influence a person's wellbeing. Lastly, you reflect on how the fundamental elements of research methods are important in the everyday application of positive psychology.\n\nAfter completing all five courses, learners earn a certificate signed by Dr. Martin E.P.

  "description" : "You should complete the VLSI CAD Part I: Logic course before beginning this course.\n\nA modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer:  a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus in this part of the course is on the key logical and geometric representations that make it possible to map from logic to layout, and in particular, to place, route, and evaluate the timing of large logic networks. Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: technology mapping, timing analysis, and ASIC placement and routing.\n\nRecommended Background:\nProgramming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.  Elementary knowledge of RC linear circuits (at the level of an introductory physics class).",

  "description" : "El aprendizaje de máquinas es una rama de la inteligencia artificial dedicada al estudio de métodos para dotar a los agentes artificiales de la capacidad de aprender a partir de ejemplos y/o experiencia. Los métodos de aprendizaje de máquinas pueden generar modelos de problemas complejos a través de instancias específicas, los cuales son capaces de generalizar y/o adaptarse a situaciones nuevas. Estos modelos han permitido llevar a cabo muchas nuevas aplicaciones en áreas muy diversas como generación de descripciones de imágenes, predicción de readmisión hospitalaria o detección de partículas subatómicas. En la actualizada frecuentemente interactuamos con modelos de aprendizaje de máquinas en diversas actividades de nuestra vida cotidiana. Por ejemplo, cuando utilizamos el teclado virtual en nuestros teléfonos móviles, un modelo de aprendizaje de máquinas trata de predecir la siguiente palabra que queremos escribir a partir de nuestro patrón de escritura y la de otros usuarios. De igual manera, al realizar una búsqueda en Internet, un modelo de aprendizaje de máquinas identifica los documentos más relevantes a ser mostrados de todos los posibles documentos usando nuestro historial de búsqueda. Al tomar una foto con nuestra cámara digital, un modelo de aprendizaje de máquinas detecta los rostros en la escena para poder enfocarlos de forma adecuada.\n\nEste es un curso básico introductorio al aprendizaje de máquinas con un enfoque práctico, el cual aborda tanto los fundamentos generales como métodos específicos y algunos aspectos prácticos. El curso aborda tanto el aprendizaje supervisado como el aprendizaje sin supervisión. Los métodos que se presentan en el curso son regresión lineal, regresión logística, redes neuronales y K-medias.",

  "description" : "La OMS en el año 2011 publicó el Informe Mundial sobre la Discapacidad, en el cual se evidencia un aumento en la prevalencia de discapacidad de un 15% (anteriormente se estimaba entre un 7 y un 10% de la población). Las personas que viven en situación de discapacidad presentan mayores niveles de deprivación en diferentes ámbitos: inserción al mercado del trabajo, nivel educacional, etc. \n\nEsto nos obliga como sociedad a repensar nuestro trabajo en esta materia desde un enfoque que garantice igual trato para todos. Pues, una sociedad que espere promover igualdad de oportunidades y espacios de desarrollo para todos sus miembros, debe poner especial atención con aquellos sectores que han sido postergados durante generaciones, esto ocurre con especial fuerza en nuestros países del tercer mundo. No obstante comprender el actual enfoque de Derechos permite orientar la acción hacía planes y programas que permitan garantizar accesibilidad e inclusión social para personas en situación de discapacidad.\n\n\nNosotros buscamos promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad, por lo que los estudiantes que desarrollen este curso desarrollen una mirada crítica de las prácticas de apoyo de las personas en situación de discapacidad. Posterior a 10 años del nacimiento de la Convención sobre los derechos de las personas con discapacidad, se hace urgente su difusión, comprensión y crítica por parte de los ciudadanos a objeto de modificar prácticas que hoy resultan contradictorias, ilegítimas e innecesarias, las que suelen atentar, en contra de la autonomía y derechos de las personas con discapacidad.\n\nEl propósito del curso es promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad. De esta manera los los estudiantes podrán reflexionar sobre el enfoque de Derechos consagrado en la Convención de Naciones Unidas sobre Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidad, las diferencias conceptuales entre modelos, enfoques y teorías en el ámbito de la discapacidad en su proceso de tránsito conceptual. De esta manera, los estudiantes analizarán distintos ámbitos de aplicación de dichos modelos y conceptualizaciones en ámbitos de salud, educación y trabajo, comprendiendo una visión integral del desarrollo humano de una sociedad desde el enfoque de derechos humanos.",

  "description" : "In the previous course in the Specialization, we learned how to compare genes, proteins, and genomes.  One way we can use these methods is in order to construct a \"Tree of Life\" showing how a large collection of related organisms have evolved over time.\n\nIn the first half of the course, we will discuss approaches for evolutionary tree construction that have been the subject of some of the most cited scientific papers of all time, and show how they can resolve quandaries from finding the origin of a deadly virus to locating the birthplace of modern humans.\n\nIn the second half of the course, we will shift gears and examine the old claim that birds evolved from dinosaurs.  How can we prove this?  In particular, we will examine a result that claimed that peptides harvested from a T. rex fossil closely matched peptides found in chickens. In particular, we will use methods from computational proteomics to ask how we could assess whether this result is valid or due to some form of contamination.\n\nFinally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to reconstruct an evolutionary tree of ebolaviruses and identify the source of the recent Ebola epidemic that caused global headlines.",

  "description" : "Sales projections are a powerful tool to aid in meeting demand, allocation of resources, and driving growth for the future. Forecasting techniques can be applied to make realistic predictions of outcomes of everything from sales volume to likelihood of cold-call success given the time of the year. Other than goods that are considered, “basic necessities,” most sales data demonstrate trends based on the season—or period of time—in which they occur. There are a multitude of statistical methods that can enhance forecasting by including the factor of seasonality. This course will introduce you to making sales projections with a multiplicative seasonal model. \n\nIn this course, we will review the principles of forecasting, consider use cases for forecasting with seasonality, build the seasonal index from the ground up, run a forecast with and without seasonality on sales data, and consider the next steps that could be taken with our seasonal forecast. Along the way, you will visualize the data and understand how forecasting with seasonality works. You will do this as we work side-by-side in the free-to-use software Google Sheets.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will understand use cases for conducting forecasts with seasonality in your workplace and be able to confidently apply seasonality in any spreadsheet software. \n\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",

  "description" : "In this course we study the ancient, Socratic art of blowing up your beliefs as you go, to make sure they're built to last. We spend six weeks studying three Platonic dialogues - \"Euthyphro\", \"Meno\", \"Republic\" Book I - then two weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato: contemporary moral theory and moral psychology. \n\nPlatonic? Socratic? Socrates was the teacher, but he said he never did. Plato was the student who put words in his teacher's mouth. You'll get a feel for it.\n\nWe have a book: the new 4th edition of \"Reason and Persuasion\", by the instructor (and his wife, Belle Waring, the translator.) It contains the Plato you need, plus introductory material and in-depth, chapter-length commentaries. (Don't worry! John Holbo knows better than to read his book to the camera. The videos cover the same material, but the presentation is different.) \n\nThe book is offered free in PDF form - the whole thing, and individual chapter slices. It is also available in print and other e-editions. See the course content for links and information.\n\nThe course is suitable for beginning students of Plato and philosophy, but is intended to offer something to more advanced students as well. We seek new, odd angles on old, basic angles. Tricky! The strategy is to make a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach.  Lots of contemporary connections, to make the weird bits intuitive; plus plenty of ancient color, still bright after all these years. So: arguments and ideas, new possibilities, old stories, fun facts. Plus cartoons. \n\nThe results can get elaborate (some book chapters and some lesson videos run long.) But each video comes with a brief summary of its contents. The lessons progress. I put them in this order for reasons. But there's no reason you can't skip over and around to find whatever seems most interesting. There are any number of self-contained mini-courses contained in this 8-week course. You are welcome to them.\n\nPlato has meant different things to different people. He's got his own ideas, no doubt. (Also, his own Ideas.) But these have, over the centuries, been worn into crossing paths for other feet; been built up into new platforms for projecting other voices. (Plato did it to Socrates, so fair is fair.) So your learning outcome should be: arrival somewhere interesting, in your head, where you haven't been before. I wouldn't presume to dictate more exactly.",

Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.” So, you will learn both in this 6-week long course.\n\nYour final project for this course is to create a pitch deck for a social media influencer strategy.

  "description" : "Whether students come from a Branding or a Customer Experience background or perspective, this course will explore the synergies between and the intersection of the two sets of activities. While there are different approaches to defining a branding strategy, a branding project’s implementation impacts many departments and their customer-facing activities. In this sense, it’s essential to understand branding efforts in the context of Customer Experience. In this course, we will use a framework - adapted from Customer Journey Mapping - for focusing and organizing students' thinking about the operational implications of their branding projects. Through the framework, we will derive an operational language for aligning activities and measuring impacts across multiple departments and the customer touch points they manage.",

  "description" : "Amazon famously delivers new code every 11.6 seconds. Just a few years ago, this was unthinkable: many ‘cutting edge’ firms would release software quarterly. When it comes to digital innovation, velocity is critical and many would say it’s the most reliable determinant of success. \n\nBringing an organization to the state of the art (or even functional capability) in this area requires strong work in a combination of disciplines and a combination of both technical and managerial skills. There is no single cookie-cutter approach for achieving this capability. Much like agile, the right focus and formulation depends a lot on the facts and circumstances of the team. This course, developed at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia and taught by top-ranked faculty, will provide you with the interdisciplinary skill set to cultivate a continuous deployment capability in your organization. \n\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to: \n1. Diagnose a team’s delivery pipeline and bring forward prioritized recommendations to improve it\n2. Explain the skill sets and roles involved in DevOps and how they contribute toward a continuous delivery capability\n3. Review and deliver automation tests across the development stack\n4. Explain the key jobs of system operations and how today’s leading techniques and tools apply to them\n5. Explain how high-functioning teams use DevOps and related methods to reach a continuous delivery capability \n6. Facilitate prioritized, iterative team progress on improving a delivery pipeline",

Conducting a factor analysis is a useful tactic to cut through the complexity in survey data so that we can land on insights that can fuel decision-making. In this project you will gain hands-on experience designing and conducting a factor analysis with survey data. To do this you will work in the free-to-use spreadsheet software Google Sheets. \n\nBy the end of this project, you will be able to confidently apply factor analysis techniques to find actionable insights within survey data using any spreadsheet software.\n\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

  "description" : "This course teaches computer programming to those with little to no previous experience. It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today’s job market.\n\nNevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. Students who successfully complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer science, gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.\n\nStudents taking the course will get a MATLAB Online license free of charge for the duration of the course. The students are encouraged to consult the eBook that this course is based on. More information about these resources can be found on the Resources menu on the right.",

  "description" : "La computación evolutiva (evolutionary computation, EC), aplica la teoría de la evolución natural y la genética en la adaptación evolutiva de estructuras computacionales, proporcionando un medio alternativo para atacar problemas complejos en diversas áreas, como la ingeniería, economía, química, medicina y, porque no, las artes. Una población de posibles soluciones de un problema dado es análoga a una población de organismos vivos que evolucionan cada generación, al recombinar los mejores individuos de la población y transmitir sus características de dichos individuos padres, a sus descendientes. En este campo, diferentes esquemas de métodos evolutivos se han desarrollado, los cuales difieren en el tipo de estructuras que conforman la población.\nAlgoritmos evolutivos (AE), como también se le conoce al cómputo evolutivo (EC), se definen como métodos de optimización y búsqueda, los cuales están inspirados y tratan de imitar de manera parcial los procesos de la evolución natural, y mantienen una población de estructuras que evolucionan de acuerdo a reglas de selección y otros operadores genéticos, como cruzamiento y mutación (Bäck, 1996).\nLos algoritmos evolutivos no son los únicos métodos de optimización propuestos a partir de sistemas biológicos. Se tiene una variedad de algoritmos de optimización, que tratan de imitar el comportamiento de sistemas naturales, como las colonias de hormigas, algoritmos culturales y optimización por cúmulos de partículas, entre otros. De aquí surge lo que se conoce como algoritmos bioinspirados, ya que toman sus bases a partir de la estructura de procesos y sistemas biológicos: la evolución, la selección natural, comportamiento social de animales, como las hormigas, abejas, peces.\n\nBÄCK, T.

  "description" : "Welcome to Integrating Scripts for Scene Interactions, the third course in the Unity Certified 3D Artist Specialization from Unity Technologies.\n\nThe courses in this series will help you prepare for the Unity Certified 3D Artist exam, the professional certification for entry- to mid-level Unity artists. 3D artists are critical to the Unity development pipeline. They are a bridge between the programmers writing the application code and the designers or art directors who define the application’s aesthetics and style. In these courses, you will be challenged to complete realistic art implementation tasks in Unity that are aligned to the topics covered on the exam.\n\nIn this third course, you will complete work on the Kitchen Configurator application - an app that lets users view a realistic rendering of a kitchen and swap out objects and materials to customize the design. Now you’ll work on the allowing users to actually interact with your beautiful design. You’ll implement a User Interface (UI) in Unity and add some pre-written scripts to the project to make it interactive. Finally, you’ll adapt the project to VR with by bringing the UI into world space. By the end of the course, you’ll have a functioning Kitchen Configurator app that would be ready to take to the final stages of production and launch.\n\nThis is an intermediate course, intended for people who are ready for their first paying roles as Unity 3D artists, or enthusiasts who would like to verify their skills against a professional standard. To succeed, you should have at least 1-2 years of experience implementing 3D art in Unity. You should be proficient at importing assets into Unity from Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools, prototyping scenes, working with lighting, and adding particles and effects. You should also have a basic understanding of 2D asset management, animation, and working with scripts. You should have experience in the full product development lifecycle, and understand multi-platform development, including for XR (AR and VR) platforms.",

Attention is drawn to specific opportunities afforded by this new field in accelerating materials development and deployment efforts. A particular emphasis is placed on materials exhibiting hierarchical internal structures spanning multiple length/structure scales and the impediments involved in establishing invertible process-structure-property (PSP) linkages for these materials. More specifically, it is argued that modern data sciences (including advanced statistics, dimensionality reduction, and formulation of metamodels) and innovative cyberinfrastructure tools (including integration platforms, databases, and customized tools for enhancement of collaborations among cross-disciplinary team members) are likely to play a critical and pivotal role in addressing the above challenges.",

  "description" : "Learn about the technologies underlying experimentation used in systems biology, with particular focus on RNA sequencing, mass spec-based proteomics, flow/mass cytometry and live-cell imaging.\n\nA key driver of the systems biology field is the technology allowing us to delve deeper and wider into how cells respond to experimental perturbations. This in turns allows us to build more detailed quantitative models of cellular function, which can give important insight into applications ranging from biotechnology to human disease. This course gives a broad overview of a variety of current experimental techniques used in modern systems biology, with focus on obtaining the quantitative data needed for computational modeling purposes in downstream analyses. We dive deeply into four technologies in particular, mRNA sequencing, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, flow/mass cytometry, and live-cell imaging. These techniques are often used in systems biology and range from genome-wide coverage to single molecule coverage, millions of cells to single cells, and single time points to frequently sampled time courses. We present not only the theoretical background upon which these technologies work, but also enter real wet lab environments to provide instruction on how these techniques are performed in practice, and how resultant data are analyzed for quality and content.",

  "description" : "HI-FIVE (Health Informatics For Innovation, Value & Enrichment) Training is a 12-hour online course designed by Columbia University in 2016, with sponsorship from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC).  The training is role-based and uses case scenarios.  Also, it has additional, optional modules on other topics of interest or relevance.  Although we suggest to complete the course within a month's timeframe, the course is self-paced and so you can start and finish the course at anytime during a month's time period. No additional hardware or software are required for this course.\n\nOur nation’s healthcare system is changing at a rapid pace. Transformative health care delivery programs depend heavily on health information technology to improve and coordinate care, maintain patient registries, support patient engagement, develop and sustain data infrastructure necessary for multi-payer value-based payment, and enable analytical capacities to inform decision making and streamline reporting.  The accelerated pace of change from new and expanding technology will continue to be a challenge for preparing a skilled workforce so taking this training will help you to stay current in the dynamic landscape of health care.\n\nThis course is one of three related courses in the HI-FIVE training program, which has topics on population health, care coordination and interoperability, value-based care, healthcare data analytics, and patient-centered care.  Each of the three courses is designed from a different perspective based on various healthcare roles.  This first course is from a clinical perspective, geared towards physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, clinical executives and managers, medical assistants, and other clinical support roles.  However, we encourage anyone working in healthcare, health IT, public health, and population health to participate in any of the three trainings.",

  "description" : "Welcome to Asymmetric Cryptography and Key Management! \n\nIn asymmetric cryptography or public-key cryptography, the sender and the receiver use a pair of public-private keys, as opposed to the same symmetric key, and therefore their cryptographic operations are asymmetric. This course will first review the principles of asymmetric cryptography and describe how the use of the pair of keys can provide different security properties. Then, we will study the popular asymmetric schemes in the RSA cipher algorithm and the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol and learn how and why they work to secure communications/access. Lastly, we will discuss the key distribution and management for both symmetric keys and public keys and describe the important concepts in public-key distribution such as public-key authority, digital certificate, and public-key infrastructure. This course also describes some mathematical concepts, e.g., prime factorization and discrete logarithm, which become the bases for the security of asymmetric primitives, and working knowledge of discrete mathematics will be helpful for taking this course; the Symmetric Cryptography course (recommended to be taken before this course) also discusses modulo arithmetic.\n\nThis course is cross-listed and is a part of the two specializations, the Applied Cryptography specialization and the Introduction to Applied Cryptography specialization.",

  "description" : "Are you ready for the new, COVID-forced, online learning paradigm? This competency-based, skill-building course will help non-U.S. students, first-generation immigrants, and foreign-born professionals better understand and master American online learning, as well as other U.S. virtual environments, for college and career success. In the post-COVID era, the course can also be very instrumental in assisting U.S.-based institutions in organizing remote learning activities for their current or prospective international students. \n\nThe current pandemic has disrupted the world of higher education and work as we know it. Many thousands of international students and professionals can no longer travel internationally at will and must now learn how to effectively study and work remotely. To excel in American online learning and work environments, international students and foreign-born professionals need to know how American universities and companies use the Internet to organize study and work, develop and execute projects, communicate ideas, collaborate, and solve organizational and technical problems. By taking this course, you will learn how to enhance your cultural knowledge and assess potential skill gaps that may hinder your online experience or negatively impact your performance in U.S. virtual learning and work environments. Throughout the course you will systematically review competencies required for online work, come to better understand common barriers for non-native students and professionals, learn how to detect and overcome competency gaps, and develop plans for self-improvement and success. We believe that you will find the course useful and gain new knowledge and skills to become more successful in your remote study/work in the U.S. \n\nThe course was previously offered as iMOOC101 and iMOOC102 \"Mastering American e-Learning\". We have updated it to reflect the new realities of the Post (well, not yet!)-COVID era. We will be glad if you could share your own experiences in navigating the new world of remote teaching, learning, and work.",

  "description" : "Have you ever wondered what is behind different cultural traits and attitudes towards the status quo? Or more broadly, what influences the Zeitgeist of a society? Generally speaking, when it comes to changing (or not) the current spirit and state of affairs of a given society or community, some people show themselves as idealists, and they can even inspire others. At the same time, some other people are traditionalists, and some are just neutral about how things are. In this guided-project you will develop an agent-based model using NetLogo that tries to use these personas to touch and generate insights around theses questions. And while doing so, you will gain some hands-on knowledge on model building and debugging.\n\nNote: This project works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",

  "description" : "In this extended-length, two-hour, project-based course, you'll learn how to add a bullet-count to a weapon in an FPS game. You'll also learn how to create a reload mechanic, create a pick-up for new ammunition and create a new weapon for the player to pick up and use.\n\nThis guided project will introduce you to the following Unity concepts:\n\n- Prefabs\n- Animation\n- Triggers\n- Inheritance\n- Coding techniques including the Input class, KeyCodes,  Interfaces, Inheritance and Polymorphism\n\nThis is Part 4, the special, extended-length finale of our four-part series on creating a weapon for your FPS game. In Part 1, we covered equipping your FPS player with a revolver. In Part 2, we learned how to create visual effects when the player pulls the trigger. Part 3 showed you how to set up the weapon's properties and apply damage effects to destructible GameObjects.\n\nThis is a stand-alone guided project, but because this is the final part of the \"FPS Weapon\" series, it is recommended that you complete the first parts before commencing this guided project.\n\nThis series also makes use of the western-themed Unity project created in Control physics with C# in Unity and the VM-compatible FPS Player script written in Create a VM Compatible First Person Camera. These compliment this guided project and, although not prerequisites, are recommended for a more well-rounded understanding of the concepts presented herein.",

  "description" : "Systems science has been instrumental in breaking new scientific ground in diverse fields such as meteorology, engineering and decision analysis.   However, it is just beginning to impact public health.   This seminar is designed to introduce students to basic tools of theory building and data analysis in systems science and to apply those tools to better understand the obesity epidemic in human populations. There will also be a lab in which students will use a simple demonstration model of food acquisition behavior using agent-based modeling on standard (free) software (netlogo).   The central organizing idea of the course is to examine the obesity epidemic at a population level as an emergent properties of complex, nested systems, with attention to feedback processes, multilevel interactions, and the phenomenon of emergence.   While the emphasis will be on obesity, the goal will be to explore ways in which the systems approach can be applied to other non-communicable diseases both nationally and internationally.  \n \nTopics will include:\na) the epidemiology of obesity across time and place,\nb) theories to explain population obesity,\nc) the role of environments and economic resources in obesity\nc) basic concepts and tools of systems science,\nd) modeling energy-balance related behaviors in context,\ne) agent-based models, systems dynamic models, and social network models",

  "description" : "With every smartphone and computer now boasting multiple processors, the use of functional ideas to facilitate parallel programming is becoming increasingly widespread. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of parallel programming, from task parallelism to data parallelism. In particular, you'll see how many familiar ideas from functional programming map perfectly to to the data parallel paradigm. We'll start the nuts and bolts how to effectively parallelize familiar collections operations, and we'll build up to parallel collections, a production-ready data parallel collections library available in the Scala standard library. Throughout, we'll apply these concepts through several hands-on examples that analyze real-world data, such as popular algorithms like k-means clustering.\n\nLearning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:\n\n- reason about task and data parallel programs,\n- express common algorithms in a functional style and solve them in parallel,\n- competently microbenchmark parallel code,\n- write programs that effectively use parallel collections to achieve performance\n\nRecommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line. This course is intended to be taken after Functional Program Design in Scala: https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2.",

Together, we will explore basic Python implementations of Pearson correlation filtering, Select-K-Best knn-based filtering, backward sequential filtering, recursive feature elimination (RFE), estimating feature importance using bagged decision trees, lasso regularization, and reducing dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We will focus on the simplest implementation, usually using Scikit-Learn functions.\n\nAll of this will be done on Ubuntu Linux, but can be accomplished using any Python I.D.E. on any operating system. We will be using the IDLE development environment to demonstrate several feature selection techniques using the publicly available Pima Diabetes dataset. \n\n\nI would encourage learners to experiment using these techniques not only for feature selection, but hyperparameter tuning as well.\n\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",

This course is devised by Richard Schechner, one of the pioneers of performance studies, in dialogue with more than a dozen expert scholars and artists. Performance Studies: An Introduction puts students in dialogue with the most important ideas, approaches, theories, and questions of this dynamic, new academic field.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this course, you should be able to:\n\nArticulate and analyze the major concepts of performance studies\nIdentify and analyze performances within the “broad spectrum of performance”--from everyday life and social media to performance art and global spectacles such as the Olympics\nComprehend key terms of performance studies, including is/as performance, restored behavior, ritual, play, make-belief/make-believe, performance in everyday life, the performative, and intercultural performance\nProduce collaborative work that demonstrates teamwork in applying ideas learned in the course\nCompare, analyze, and interpret performances of their own and other cultures\nArticulate how the major concepts of the course relate to their own experiences and worldviews\nAnalyze and criticize in a constructive way the work of classmates\n\nThe lessons present Schechner’s concept of performance studies along with online assignments. In the assignments, students apply what they are learning by composing short responses to materials, writing in their NYU Classes Forums, and by reviewing other students’ forum posts each week.\n\nStudents choose either to work in groups of 3 to 5 on a term-long project maintaining a project portfolio in NYU Classes or to write a research paper. During the term, each group will lead an in-class 25-minute discussion of their project-in-progress. During the last face-to-face class, each group will present their project.\n\nThe weekly content is: \n\nWhat is Performance?\nWhat is Performance Studies?\nPerformance Processes\nFrom Not Performing to Performing\nRitual\nPlay\nPerforming in the Paleolithic\nRamlila of Ramnagar\nThe Performing Brain\nPerformativity\nConstructing Social Roles\nSocial Media\nIntercultural, Transcultural, Global\nGroup Projects & Wrap Up\nCourse Requirements\n\nEach student is required to complete the week’s online lesson prior to the class session, attend and participate in the class sessions, complete the weekly assignments, participate and present the group project or submit a final paper.\n\nRequired Readings\n\nSee weekly online lessons.\n\nRequired Viewings (Videos)\n\nSee weekly online lessons.\n\nWritten work\n\nEach student will either participate in a group project or write a research paper due at the end of the term, submitted electronically. Your professor will confer online and/or face-to-face during office hours to help students develop their writing and their projects. If you do a group project your professor may ask you to do some writing in relationship to your project.\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nThe policy on plagiarism and academic honesty is posted on Classes.

  "description" : "Курс посвящен изучению макроэкономических вопросов, таких как долгосрочный рост, циклические колебания экономики и стабилизационная политика государства.\n\nЦелью курса является знакомство слушателей с основными понятиями макроэкономики, с базовыми моделями и принципами, которые используются при анализе текущего состояния экономики той или иной страны, что позволит самостоятельно ориентироваться в происходящих процессах и явлениях, а также проводить оценку эффективности и необходимости проводимой государством макроэкономической политики.\n\nДанный курс покрывает на базовом уровне все основные темы макроэкономики. Примерно две трети курса посвящены анализу общего равновесия на рынках труда, заемных средств, финансовых, денежных, товарных рынках, а также международных потоков капитала. Изучается долгосрочный экономический рост, идущий за счет накопления капитальных мощностей и технического прогресса.  Вторая часть курса посвящена изучению природы краткосрочных колебаний вокруг долгосрочной траектории роста, таким как финансовый кризис и мировая рецессия 2008-2009 годов. Обсуждаются причины подобных спадов, а также оптимальная стабилизационная политика государства, призванная либо предотвращать подобные катаклизмы, либо сглаживать последствия от них.\n\nДля успешного прохождения курса желательно (но не обязательно) иметь базовые знания по микроэкономике.\n\nПоявились технические трудности?

  "description" : "The United States social safety net is a complex system with many programs and often difficult eligibility requirements. Many of these programs only deliver in-kind aid (not cash) to people living in poverty, a lot of whom can fall through the cracks and can’t make ends meet. \n\nBasic income, the idea of providing people with a minimal level of cash support on a consistent basis, remains a point of debate in the United States and beyond. In this Teach-Out, you will join leading experts to explore the emerging idea of basic income and other associated social safety net programs. \n\nThe Teach-Out will address the following questions:\nWhat is basic income?\nWhat is the difference between basic income and universal basic income?\nWhy is basic income generating so much interest now?\nHow does basic income work? What are the benefits and the challenges?\nHow might basic income help create an inclusive economy?\nWhat is the social safety net? Who does it help and who does it leave out?\nHow do we currently measure poverty and determine who is eligible for safety net programs? \nHow do automation and a changing economy affect the basic income conversation? \n\nNote: This Teach-Out originally launched in July 2018. Some of the examples, studies discussed, and perspectives may have changed since we recorded these conversation, but the core content of the Teach-Out remains extremely relevant today. Please enjoy this relaunched version of the Teach-Out, we encourage you to engage in the discussion forums with other learners.",

  "description" : "Starting in the late 1990s, “globalization” became a buzzword to describe the apparent integration of markets in the world economy. Many authors and pundits claimed that the world was converging towards a market-friendly democratic place, while gurus and consulting firms were not short of formulae and advice on how to make profits out of the global economy. Decades later, new realities show that globalization does not mean political, cultural, and economic convergence and that forces against it are strong.\n\nThis course seeks to help you understand the forces of globalization and how cross-cultural management and the relationship of a multinational organization to various host countries is becoming more and more critical in today’s global economy. This course begins with the discussion of these issues and global relationships and delves into a deeper understanding of business strategy in today’s global business marketplace.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tUnderstand how we got here and why it matters\n•\tUnderstand the complexities of the current globalization (not all countries are the same)\n•\tEvaluate the effects of international trade regulations on international business\n•\tEvaluate when and why should we operate as multinationals\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

  "description" : "Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.\n\nThis course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.",

Its newly launched top-line product was gaining momentum in the marketplace. However, a price adjustment at the peak season stimulated a significant demand surge which took AK completely by surprise and resulted in huge backorders. AK faced the risk of losing the market momentum due to the upset customers and the high cost associated with over-time production and expedited shipping. Accurate demand forecast is essential for increasing revenue and reducing cost. Identifying the drivers for demand and assessing their impact on demand can help companies better influence and stimulate demand.\n\nI hope you enjoy the course!",

  "description" : "What you’ll achieve:\nIn this project-centered course* you will build a modern computer system, from the ground up. We’ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.\n\nWhat you’ll need:\nThis is a self-contained course: all the knowledge necessary to succeed in the course and build the computer system will be given as part of the learning experience. Therefore, we assume no previous computer science or engineering knowledge, and all learners are welcome aboard. You will need no physical materials, since you will build the computer on your own PC, using a software-based hardware simulator, just like real computers are designed by computer engineers in the field. The hardware simulator, as well as other software tools, will be supplied freely after you enroll in the course.\n\nCourse format:\nThe course consists of six modules, each comprising a series of video lectures, and a project. You will need about 2-3 hours to watch each module's lectures, and about 5-10 hours to complete each one of the six projects. The course can be completed in six weeks, but you are welcome to take it at your own pace. You can watch a TED talk about this course by Googling \"nand2tetris TED talk\".\n\n*About Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts as you learn, you’ll master the course content more efficiently; you’ll also get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in your life and career. When you complete the course, you’ll have a finished project that you’ll be proud to use and share.",

  "description" : "In this project you will create a guessing game application that pits the computer against the user. You will create variables, static methods, decision constructs, and loops in Java to create the game.\n\nLearning Java gives the programmer a wide variety of career paths to choose from. Java was once the property of Sun Microsystems but is now an open-source (free) programming language that is used in web programming, mobile applications, and many desktop applications. Java is a natural choice for object-oriented programming as it contains many existing classes for the programmer to use from its feature-rich API. In addition, Java is truly cross-platform, which means it can be compiled on a Windows system and executed on a Mac or Linux system. Java contains a built-in garbage collector that removes objects no longer needed in the application which reduces memory leak issues.\n\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",

  "description" : "This course follows the extraordinary development of Western Christianity from its early persecution under the Roman Empire in the third century to its global expansion with the Jesuits of the early modern world. We explore the dynamic and diverse character of a religion with an enormous cast characters. We will meet men and women who tell stories of faith as well as of violence, suppression, and division. Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Luther’s protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.\n \nWe shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinas’ great Summa. We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvin’s Geneva to Elizabeth’s England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.\n \nChristianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence. It echoed with calls for God’s world to be transformed, it inspired the most sublime art and architecture, yet it also revealed the power of the union of cross and sword to destroy. The course is a journey through the formation of the West as one strand of Christianity, as one chapter in a global story. It is a journey that has shaped our world.",

  "description" : "Functional programming is becoming increasingly widespread in industry. This trend is driven by the adoption of Scala as the main programming language for many applications. Scala fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with both Java and Javascript. Scala is the implementation language of many important frameworks, including Apache Spark, Kafka, and Akka. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, Tumblr and also Coursera.\n\nIn this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically.\n\nThe course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series programming projects as homework assignments.\n\nRecommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line.",

  "description" : "Exploration of Data Science requires certain background in probability and statistics. This course introduces you to the necessary sections of probability theory and statistics, guiding you from the very basics all way up to the level required for jump starting your ascent in Data Science. \n\nThe core concept of the course is random variable — i.e. variable whose values are determined by random experiment. Random variables are used as a model for data generation processes we want to study. Properties of the data are deeply linked to the corresponding properties of random variables, such as expected value, variance and correlations. Dependencies between random variables are crucial factor that allows us to predict unknown quantities based on known values, which forms the basis of supervised machine learning. We begin with the notion of independent events and conditional probability, then introduce two main classes of random variables: discrete and continuous and study their properties. Finally, we learn different types of data and their connection with random variables.\n\nWhile introducing you to the theory, we'll pay special attention to practical aspects for working with probabilities, sampling, data analysis, and data visualization in Python.\n\nThis course requires basic knowledge in Discrete mathematics (combinatorics) and calculus (derivatives, integrals).",

  "description" : "This course evaluates the medieval history of Toledo from the era of the Visigoth Kingdom (6th-8th centuries) through its Islamic period (8th to 11th centuries) and into its reintegration into Christian Spain (after 1085 c.e.) In particular, we take note of the cultural and religious transformations that characterized the city with a special effort to understand how many peoples and religions came to settle and live amongst one another. We will virtually-tour the Islamic and Christian structures of the Museo de Santa Cruz, Iglesia de San Román, Sinagoga del Tránsito, Mezquita de Bab al-Mardum, Archivo Municipal de Toledo, and the Archivo Historico de la Nobleza.\n\nWe examine the Visigoths transition from Christian Arianism to Catholicism and the harsh treatment of the Jewish population. We explore Islamic governance and development of the medieval city of three faiths, with a special interest in its cultural achievements. We will study King Alfonso “The Wise” (1252-1284)’s efforts to characterize himself as the “king of three religions” via his legal codices, the creation of the Cantigas de Santa María, and his intellectual endeavor known as the Toledo School of Translators. We evaluate the robust Jewish and converso noble families of the city and appreciate their intellectual, religious, and economic contributions to Castilian life. We will bear witness to the rise of anti-Jewish blood purity statutes, the creation of the Inquisition, and the expulsion of the Jews. We also briefly introduce and study Spanish manuscripts from the municipal and cathedral archives to make new scholarly breakthroughs relating to the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim interrelations.\n\nNo knowledge of Spanish is needed to participate in the course or in our transcription efforts.",

  "description" : "In this course, you’ll increase your knowledge of and experience with relational tables as you explore alternative ways of getting data into tables. You’ll also look at some of the advanced features that can give relational tables super powers.  As you learn about the new features, you’ll use SQLiteStudio to apply them to your tables. Those features will enable your tables to more efficiently manage data—while keeping your data safe and accurate.  \n\nTables are great for data storage. The concept of organizing data in rows and columns is familiar to most people. Accountants use spreadsheets to organize financial data, making it easier to budget and track expenses. Parents use lists with columns to track their family’s schedules so that everyone gets to participate in outside activities. Even the Internal Revenue Service gets in the game by using tax tables to provide tax amounts for a variety of incomes. Even a simple grocery list is tabular in nature. Each row is an item, with one column having the item's name/description, and a second column noting the quantity needed. It’s no surprise that database designers like to use tables in a relational database to organize and store data. In the Design and Create a Relational Database Table Using SQLiteStudio course you learned about tables. You created and populated a relational table using the SQLiteStudio database management system. That was a great beginning.  Now it's time for the next step!",

The idea behind this MOOC  is to give you the basic tools to  be able to predict and eventually mitigate   things called  flutter, galloping, sloshing, vortex-induced vibrations, added mass,  to cite a few. \n\nWe are going to consider  any  possible domains of applications  such as civil engineering,  aerospace engineering, nuclear engineering , ocean engineering, biomechanics and even food  processing !\n\nThis is why we  called the course “Fundamentals of Fluid Solid Interactions ”. There are so many phenomena and so many models  that  we   need to work together on the basic mechanisms .\n\nIf  you want to see how fluid-solid interactions work,  and be able to use that knowledge, join us !\n\n A first session of the course was run in early 2016, with learners from over 100 countries. It is now  available with subtitles, in English and now in Chinese.\n\nSee the  video  at http://goo.gl/YKSMnD",

  "description" : "This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.\n\nThis course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.\n\nThe course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module.\n\nThe course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.\n\nWeek 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.",

  "description" : "The tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery have sparked a wave of renewed protests against police brutality across the United States. These nationwide uprisings have transformed into an intense interest from the public around understanding systemic racism and abuse of power. Millions of Americans and people around the world are watching incidents of police violence and excessive force captured on video, but are looking to learn about the inequalities at the root of these incidents. While the calls of  Black Lives Matter protesters to #DefundThePolice are being heard for the first time by many Americans, they are part of a longstanding effort by communities and activists to reinvest in communities rather than policing and prisons. In this Teach-Out, you will learn about the history of police violence in America, become aware of laws and policies that prevent accountability, understand the demands of protesters, and gain the knowledge and tools to fight for change locally.",

  "description" : "Whenever the word “accounting” is pronounced, it is immediately associated with the need to memorize endless boring numbers. However, it is the common financial statements that contain important information that provides inputs for valuation of investment projects. The only challenge is how to properly extract them.\n\nAccounting and finance are indeed intertwined. Sometimes people that are not experienced in the area even mix them up. But most often emphasis in accounting is on numbers. Still, the deep understanding of key accounting concepts helps reveal the interests and actions of people behind these numbers. And the human dimension of accounting adds invaluable insight in the potential of successful project implementation.\n\nThis Course discusses core ideas and concepts of both financial and managerial accounting. It by no means pretends to be comprehensive to any extent. But, being rather an accounting overview, it focuses on the issues that are most relevant and important for effective valuation of investment projects.\n\nThe learners will gain insight into the essence of accounting. They will be able to use the obtained knowledge and skills to successfully advance in their career at a financial institution, as well as in the area of financial management at non-financial businesses. To pursue a career in accounting, a more detailed study is strongly recommended.",

  "description" : "The goal of this capstone spacecraft dynamics project is to employ the skills developed in the rigid body Kinematics, Kinetics and Control courses.  An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance. \n\nTasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated.\n\nTasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed.  \n\nTasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance.\n\nTasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet.",

  "description" : "Aprenda os conceitos e abordagens básicos necessários para compreender, criar e executar música contemporânea.\n\nSe você é apaixonado por música e tem curiosidade de como ela funciona, ou se é um músico que aprendeu a tocar de ouvido, sem um estudo formal, esse curso lhe oferecerá uma introdução envolvente de conceitos e abordagens chave para compreender, criar e executar música contemporânea. Ministrado pelo professor George W. Russell Jr. do Berklee College of Music, o curso inclui seis lições que exploram harmonia e o treino de ouvido - duas áreas de foco intensivo para todo aluno iniciante na Berklee. \n\nO curso lhe ensinará a as escalas pentatônicas maiores e menores e como elas são construídas. Você aprenderá quais são os intervalos, como cantá-los e como encontrá-los na música. O curso explora o tom central e como encontrar qual o tom de uma música, além de divisões de compasso comuns como 4/4 e 3/4. Você aprenderá a construir acordes - tríades maiores e menores, e acordes maiores e com sétima dominante - e como construir uma progressão de acordes comum - o I IV V. Você também aprenderá a reconhecer os formatos de música blues e AABA e a escrever uma sequência de acordes básica para expressar suas ideias musicais. \n\nAlém das aulas em vídeo, cada aula envolve apresentações e entrevistas com alunos da Berklee. Os alunos compartilham suas jornadas musicais e oferecem orientações para aqueles que querem estudar música. O ponto alto do curso é uma tarefa que solicita que você componha e execute um riff de melodia em blues usando a escala pentatônica menor. Acima de tudo, o curso foi pensado para compartilhar o prazer de criar música e compartilhá-la com os outros.",

  "description" : "If you really care about the big questions in the economies and societies of the 21st century, such as distributive justice - namely, inequality of income or wealth, and its correlation with economic growth - this course is meant for you. The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our world.\n\n\"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice -  Maximizing Social Wellbeing\" is the second part of a two part course and it includes the following five lectures: \n(1) The excess burden of taxation\n(2) Tax incidence: who bears the economic burden of tax?\n(3) Progressivity: definition and ways to achieve\n(4) Low Income, Low Ability and the Optimal Income Tax Model\n(5) Designing the Tax and Transfer System that Maximizes Social Wellbeing\nIf you haven't done that already, we strongly recommend that you register for the first part of the course: \"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State\". Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.\n\nThe course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.\n\nThe course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:\n• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;\n• Technology as the engine of economic growth;\n• Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?\n\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard's Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.\n\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to:\n• better understand economic issues presented in the media\n• form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies\n• define and measure inequality and poverty\n• define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\n• explain the foundations of economic growth\n• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals\n\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.\n\n\nIn order to receive academic credit for this course you must successfully pass the academic exam on campus. For information on how to register for the academic exam – https://tauonline.tau.ac.il/registration\n\nAdditionally, you can apply to certain degrees using the grades you received on the courses. Read more on this here – \nhttps://go.tau.ac.il/b.a/mooc-acceptance\n\nTeachers interested in teaching this course in their class rooms are invited to explore our Academic High school program here – https://tauonline.tau.ac.il/online-highschool\n\nThis course is a direct extension of the first part \"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice Part I -The Role of the State\", so if you have not yet taken it, we highly recommend you start your learning from there (https://www.coursera.org/learn/economic-growth-part-1/home/welcome).",

  "description" : "Markets begins with one of the most common and important elements of the financial system – interest rates.  You will learn why interest rates have always been a key barometer in determining the value of everything.  You will explore the changing influence of interest rates; the impact of interest rates on consumption, investment and economic growth; and the bizarre realities of negative interest rates. Markets explains how interest rates change the value of all financial instruments, highlighting the role of the bond and stock markets that have toppled empires.  We take a closer look at the equity pricing models and equity markets that reverberate across the globe, and explore everything from the first stock ever issued – by the Dutch East India Company – to the little-understood but powerful derivative securities market.  By the end of the course, you will have developed insight into the intersections of the financial markets with worlds of policy, politics, and power. You will have demonstrated that insight by teaching an important financial concept and translating a financial product or transaction to someone who will clearly benefit from your advice.",

  "description" : "Which are the deepest roots of that mix of cultures that we use to call ‘Mediterranean Civilization’? Which are comminglings and exchanges which produced its most complete fruit, i.e. the city, a place for landscape-modelling communities? And which elements did contribute to build up that baulk of customs, ideas, and innovations which compelled to confrontation and hybridizations different peoples for millennia? What did it made, from pottery to metallurgy, from gastronomy to architecture, from art to religion, of a sea a cradle of civilization? Archaeology may help in disentangling such questions, seeking unexpected answers , by tinkering what ancient Mediterranean peoples left buried in the ground. A privileged point of view of our course is the ancient Phoenician city of Motya, located exactly at the centre of the “sea in the middle”. Throughout the live experience of excavation, with images taken on the field, this course will let you touch the many tesserae of the great mosaic of the Mediterranean Civilization. The field diary of the archaeologist, and the handpick will be the two tools, which will lead us across the sea to discover what such early cities actually were, and how their contribute is still a major part of our shared memory.",

  "description" : "Focusing on the Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) of the world, this course will introduce the concept and practice of ecosystem-based management. LMEs occupy areas of coastal ocean at least 200 000 km² or greater in size. These coastal waters produce 12.6 trillion USD in ecosystem goods and services annually and are vitally important for billions of people around the globe.\n\nBecause LMEs are bounded by ocean features and are globally linked, management of human activities needs to occur in an integrated fashion across political boundaries and economic sectors (e.g. fishing, shipping, energy, tourism, and mining.) This represents a new type of management approached - shifting from single sector-based to multi-sector assessment and management within the spatial domain of the world's 66 Large Marine Ecosystems. There is global high-level support for this new approach and in this course, we will introduce the concepts and tools for assessing and managing LMEs.\n\nTogether, leaders and experts in a global movement to recover and sustain the goods and services of LMEs will introduce you to the mechanisms used for assessment (Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis), planning and implementation (Strategic Action Programme). Based on recent activities in implementation and practice of the LME approach in 22 projects around the globe, we will showcase examples of effective management at this scale, and highlight the challenges and issues. By the end of the online course, we hope you will be able to actively use this knowledge to advance sustainable development of the world’s oceans.\n\nThe course was created with the support and input of: the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), UNESCO-IOC and IW:LEARN.",

  "description" : "This is the fifth course in the IBM AI Enterprise Workflow Certification specialization.   You are STRONGLY encouraged to complete these courses in order as they are not individual independent courses, but part of a workflow where each course builds on the previous ones.\n\nThis course introduces you to an area that few data scientists are able to experience: Deploying models for use in large enterprises.  Apache Spark is a very commonly used framework for running machine learning models.  Best practices for using Spark will be covered in this course.  Best practices for data manipulation, model training, and model tuning will also be covered.  The use case will call for the creation and deployment of a recommender system. The course wraps up with an introduction to model deployment technologies.\n \nBy the end of this course you will be able to:\n1.  Use Apache Spark's RDDs, dataframes, and a pipeline\n2.  Employ spark-submit scripts to interface with Spark environments\n3.  Explain how collaborative filtering and content-based filtering work\n4.  Build a data ingestion pipeline using Apache Spark and Apache Spark streaming\n5.  Analyze hyperparameters in machine learning models on Apache Spark\n6.  Deploy machine learning algorithms using the Apache Spark machine learning interface\n7.  Deploy a machine learning model from Watson Studio to Watson Machine Learning\n\nWho should take this course?\nThis course targets existing data science practitioners that have expertise building machine learning models, who want to deepen their skills on building and deploying AI in large enterprises. If you are an aspiring Data Scientist, this course is NOT for you as you need real world expertise to benefit from the content of these courses.\n\nWhat skills should you have?\nIt is assumed that you have completed Courses 1 through 4 of the IBM AI Enterprise Workflow specialization and you have a solid understanding of the following topics prior to starting this course: Fundamental understanding of Linear Algebra; Understand sampling, probability theory, and probability distributions; Knowledge of descriptive and inferential statistical concepts; General understanding of machine learning techniques and best practices; Practiced understanding of Python and the packages commonly used in data science: NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn; Familiarity with IBM Watson Studio; Familiarity with the design thinking process.",

  "description" : "The world is urbanizing fast. In less than a century more than 1 billion people have been urbanized. That translates into the fact that more than half of the world’s population is already living in cities. Experts forecast that very soon Africa will become one of the most urbanized continents. However, almost 70% of world’s urban population is living in the cities where governments are struggling to provide basic services like sanitation, schools, hospitals, and adequate clean water. \n\nThe reason is that, their governments do not have enough money. This may also be true also for the city where you live or work. Poor infrastructure affects your daily life. Local governments struggle with mobilizing finances so that they can improve your quality of life but many times they are not aware of the right mechanisms. \n\nImagine that your government wants to know how can they finance cities and they want you to advise – where will you begin with? Our finance experts are bringing their experience right at your Desk through this MOOC. This MOOC has five modules and in five weeks you will learn:\n•\tFinancial decision making environment in urban systems\n•\tMechanisms for mobilizing local revenues\n•\tInnovative mechanisms for financing infrastructure projects through partnerships, and \n•\tFinancial decision making under uncertainties and risks\n\nWe will provide you a carefully selected set of literature, quizzes and interactive discussion forums. So join our MOOC and find out the ways to make your city a better place to live in for yourself and for your next generations.\n\n(This MOOC was developed in collaboration with the United Cities and Local Governments of Africa (UCLG-Africa), African Local Governments Academy (ALGA), and Erasmus University Rotterdam)",

  "description" : "This course addresses recorded vocal performances and the technologies used to highlight and support them in modern record production and mixes. Most of us know that vocals serve as the focal point of modern recordings but many do not know the tools used or when the tools are used best in modern record production.\n\nThe course begins with simple vocal placement in a mix, where you will also learn the fundamentals of compression and equalization. You’ll further study delays and reverbs before moving to advanced concepts in audio editing, synthetic processing, automatic & graphic pitch correction, time compression, time expansion, flex and elastic audio. \n\nThrough analysis and/or hands on projects that the students will post for peer review, the student will gain an understanding of the many choices available to modern record producers as they record and mix with a modern tool set. You’ll see, in action, the Vocoder, Auto-Tune, Melodyne, Elastic Audio, Flex Time, VocAlign, tempo based editing and a host of other file modification protocols that are readily available on most Digital Audio Workstations. This course gives students a thorough look at the expanded choices that have risen in the art of vocal production as a result of these modern tools.\n\nThe goal of the course is to help interested novices understand the recordings they are listening to, performers find an expanded language for their recorded voices and for vocal producers to be able to create musically artistic visualizations using singers as their paintbrushes.",

  "description" : "This free course from the University of London explores critical thinking, and the interpretation of texts, through the Shakespeare authorship question. Using doubt about Shakespeare’s authorship as our playground, we will explore the key concept of authorship attribution, while developing skills in literary analysis, interpretation, and argument. Through forensic exploration of key texts, you will learn why Shakespeare’s authorship is questioned, and what evidence is cited on both sides of the debate.\n\nFor those of you interested in exploring the works of Shakespeare from a new angle, or just wanting to hone your analytical thinking skills, this course offers an introduction to a fascinating area of interest. Those of you already interested in the Shakespeare authorship question will be encouraged to question your own assumptions in fruitful ways. Whether undertaken as a standalone course, or as preparation for the University of London BA in English, this course will be food for thought.",

  "description" : "The blues is an American art form and the most important musical form in jazz. Although there are other formal paradigms of the blues, such as 8-bar or 16-bar, this course focuses on different incarnations of the 12-bar blues. There are considerable differences between Early Jazz blues, Swing blues, Bebop blues, Modal blues, and Post Bop blues. Each type has its unique harmonic syntax, melodic vocabulary and, associated with them, improvisational techniques. While other aspects of jazz performance practice have been constantly changing from one stylistic convention to another, the blues has never lost its identity and expressive power, and continues to exert a powerful influence on the harmonic and melodic syntax of jazz.\n\nThis seven-week course explores important aspects of the blues, blues improvisation, basic keyboard textures, jazz harmonic and melodic syntax. Topics include: (1) Blues Progressions; (2) Blues and Other Scales; (3) Improvisational Tools, and others. This course will also cover valuable theoretical concepts enabling the student to master the art of jazz improvisation. Each topic will be introduced from a practical perspective with the clearly stated goal: to improve one’s improvisational skills. Jazz improvisation is rooted in spontaneity, creativity, self-expression and, at the same time, self-control and order. A unique pedagogical approach based on a one-to-one musical interaction conducted with different instrumentalists will help to reinforce many of the concepts introduced in this course and realize its stated objectives.",

It may be useful for professional psychologists, for specialists whose activity involves empathy, inspiration, understanding and creating of daily life, and for all who are interested in the topic. \n\nThe main idea of the course\nGenius, talent and golden mediocrity are different (perpendicularly oriented) dimensions of human existence. They should be studied coherently with their manifestations. All together they construct a space for creative life, but each taken separately provokes traumatic, devastating and exhausting forms of anxieties. Our course shows how these three dimensions manifest themselves in life and how you can fulfill your genius, abilities, talents more fully and completely.\n\nOur Method\nWe critically examine the manifestations of the studied \"dimensions\" (phenomena), in order that by putting off all \"the supposed\" we could find specific and inherent meaning. The phenomenological method is to understand and express in simple terms the fundamental structure of creative activity, to express everything that was, that is and that will be important in the psychology of creative life.\n\nCourse objective\nOur main objective is a phenomenological description of genius, talent and golden mediocrity as specific dimensions of human life, correction of errors and misapprehensions of common sense regarding these phenomena.\n\nWhat you gain\nAfter taking this course you will know what it is to be genius. You will see the phenomena of mediocrity and talent in a new light. You will understand these phenomena better based on our various examples. You will also be able to practice various aspects of these dimensions of creativity in your daily life.",

  "description" : "This course will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on mammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?\n\nThe course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate “how” cell- level functions arise and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.",

  "description" : "System Validation is the field that studies the fundamentals of system communication and information processing. It allows automated analysis based on behavioural models of a system to see if a system works correctly. We want to guarantee that the systems does exactly what it is supposed to do. The techniques put forward in system validation allow to prove the absence of errors. It allows to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound and as a side effect enforces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful. This means that the systems are not only behaving correctly, but are also much easier to maintain and adapt. ’Modeling Software Protocols, and other behaviour' demonstrates the power of formal methods in software modelling, communication protocols, and other examples.

  "description" : "This course provides an analytical framework to help you evaluate key problems in a structured fashion and will equip you with tools to better manage the uncertainties that pervade and complicate business processes. The course aim to cover statistical ideas that apply to managers. We will consider two basic themes: first, is recognizing and describing variations present in everything around us, and then modeling and making decisions in the presence of these variations. The fundamental concepts studied in this course will reappear in many other classes and business settings. Our focus will be on  interpreting the meaning of the results in a business and managerial setting.\n\nWhile you will be introduced to some of the science of what is being taught, the focus will be on applying the methodologies.  This will be accomplished through use of Excel and using data sets from many different disciplines, allowing you to see the use of statistics in very diverse settings. The course will focus not only on explaining these concepts but also understanding the meaning of the results obtained.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tTest for beliefs about a population..\n•\tCompare differences between populations.\n•\tUse linear regression model for prediction. \n•\tLearn how to use Excel for statistical analysis.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

  "description" : "WARNING: THESE VIDEOS CONTAIN IMAGES OF HUMAN DISSECTION. MAY BE DISTURBING TO SOME.\n\nHuman structure is important to all of us as it has been for millennia.  Artists, teachers, health care providers, scientists and most children try to understand the human form from stick figure drawings to electron microscopy. Learning the form of people is of great interest to us – physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel and many, many others.\n\nLearning anatomy classically involved dissection of the deceased whether directly in the laboratory or from texts, drawings, photographs or videos.  There are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy.  Developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources.\n\nIn this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy.  Some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning.\n\nAll of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the Yale School of Medicine.\n\nThe sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections.  Each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end.  Following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge.  \n\nWe hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people.\n\nANATOMY OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WAS PRODUCED IN PART DUE TO THE GENEROUS FUNDING OF THE DAVID F. SWENSEN FUND FOR INNOVATION IN TEACHING.\n\nThis work was supported in part by the Kaplow Family Fund, Yale School of Medicine.\f\nCOURSE CURRICULUM:  ANATOMY OF THE THORAX, HEART, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS\n\nRECOMMENDED TEXT\t\nGRAY’S ANATOMY FOR STUDENTS, RICHARD L DRAKE, ELSEVIER.

  "description" : "Как так получается, что вопреки распространённой поговорке руки растут именно из плеч, а не из другого места? Это происходит благодаря тому, что клетки помнят эту информацию и вовремя «включают» и «выключают» нужные гены. Клетки могут помнить даже то, занимаетесь ли вы спортом и как часто употребляете алкоголь, как чувствовала себя ваша мама, когда была беременна вами, и какими вирусными инфекциями вы переболели в детстве. Такую способность, как клеточная память, изучает эпигенетика. О том, как активность генов влияет на работу клеток и всего организма в целом, мы расскажем вам в нашем новом онлайн-курсе «Эпигенетика. Краткий курс по управлению генами».\nПосмотрев наш курс, вы точно не перепутаете эпигенетику с родственной генетикой, ведь в то время как первая только «предполагает», как поведут себя ваши гены, вторая «располагает» механизмами их управления. Вы узнаете, существует ли эликсир «вечной молодости», и что происходит с клетками, когда мы стареем? Зачем нужны стволовые клетки и смогут ли они продлить нам жизнь? Почему нам нужны хромосомы от обоих родителей? Вы увидите, как устроена клеточная память, и как её можно использовать для лечения некоторых сложных заболеваний. А ещё мы расскажем вам, как поймать преступника с помощью эпигенетики. \nНаши преподаватели расскажут вам очень много удивительных вещей о строении клеток и работе организма. Вы сможете больше узнать о собственном здоровье, здоровье своих будущих детей, а также о передовых технологиях, которые уже используют учёные, чтобы сделать мир лучше. Мы будем рады всем, кого интересует биология, генетика, медицина и собственное здоровье. Присоединяйтесь, будет интересно!",

  "description" : "In this class, we will derive equilibrium outcomes across a variety of market structures. We will begin by understanding equilibrium under a market structure called Perfect Competition, a benchmark construction. Economists have tools to measure the efficiency of market outcomes. We next consider the polar extreme of a competitive market: a monopoly market. We will determine the monopoly equilibrium price and quantity and efficiency properties. Much economic activity takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs when externalities are present. We will examine one key externality, pollution, and construct a policy prescription to mitigate the negative efficiency impacts of this externality.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tExplain how different market structures result in different resource allocations.\n•\tModel the impact of external shocks to a particular market structure and demonstrate the new equilibrium price and quantity after the impact of this external shock has played out.\n•\tEvaluate the efficiency of an equilibrium. Different market structures produce different levels of efficiency.  \n•\tExplain when and why the government might intervene with regulatory authority or antitrust litigation to lessen inefficiencies in some markets.\n•\tDescribe how information problems can cause inefficient outcomes.\n•\tUnderstand externalities and consider optimal government response to these market failures.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

This approach will allow us to lay the foundation for the design of complex digital systems.\n\nYou will learn a set of design methodologies and will use a set of (educational-oriented) computer-aided-design tools (CAD) that will allow you not only to design small and medium size circuits, but also to access to higher level courses covering so exciting topics as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) design or computer architecture, to give just two examples.\n\nCourse topics are complemented with the design of a simple processor, introduced as a transversal example of a complex digital system. This example will let you understand and feel comfortable with some fundamental computer architecture terms as the instruction set, microprograms and microinstructions.\n\nAfter completing this course you will be able to:\n\n   * Design medium complexity digital systems.\n   * Understand the description of digital systems using high-level languages such as VHDL.\n   * Understand how computers operate at their most basic level (machine language).",

Techniques for Data Collection will reinforce the importance of built trust and rapport with your client and stakeholders, which in turn creates buy in. Students will then learn how to enter a community, conduct rapid assessments to provide a snapshot of the community or organization, and maintain ethical conduct throughout. System Mapping & Analysis will focus on mapping systems and stakeholders, two different techniques that are useful to visualize systems and identify and evaluate a network of stakeholders. Finally, in Conducting Interviews & Surveys, students will learn different techniques to collect information. From focus group interview to one-on-one interviews, to surveys, systems thinkers need a mix of approaches in their toolbox to identify assess needs and assets, engage stakeholders, and collect information throughout all phases of project implementation.",

  "description" : "This course is for you if you are interested in transitioning toward a managerial role in cybersecurity and mobility. Through interviews with industry experts in this area, you will be able to analyze innovations powering the rapid spread of information technology and how they present new challenges for protecting data. For example, mobile devices increase convenience but often bypass traditional security measures. After this course, you will be able to describe how the nature of the threat evolves, as culprits employ a burgeoning set of sophisticated tools to take advantage of our growing reliance on networks for critical-data exchange.\n\nIf you want to pursue a career in the public sector, the stakes are high as well. The proliferation of hackers, inevitable human errors, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives, and the ever-broadening need to share information weigh heavily on government and education organizations, and consume substantial resources. The Pentagon, for example, has proposed to spend $23 billion on network security initiatives through 2018. This sounds like a large sum, until you consider the scope and importance of the U.S. government information resources this investment must protect.\n\nAfter completing the course modules you will be able to explain how yesterday’s prevention strategies are no longer adequate for stopping advanced, targeted attacks. Effective cybersecurity must be multi-dimensional and tiered, as threats can originate from virtually anywhere, target numerous levels of an organization, and sometimes persist for months or years before an information security staff is aware of an attack or breach. Therefore securing networks requires a holistic approach that incorporates several elements.",

  "description" : "This course is multidisciplinary in nature, and aims to equip the global audience of interested lay people, people with chronic disease, public health researchers, health clinicians, students, administrators, and researchers to reflect on the overall impact of the burden of chronic disease . It shows how all chronic diseases (obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer) are related by a set of common causes, and that such diseases should be tackled, not individually, but as part of a complex system, with interrelated contributing factors. These factors are genetic, environmental, psychological, economic, social, developmental, and media related. \n\nThe Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney is a unique interdisciplinary education and research hub which seeks solutions to chronic disease through a complex systems approach. Academics in many disciplines (in Science and Medicine, but also in Architecture, Humanities, Law etc)  work in a collaborative fashion to produce novel solutions to the problems of chronic disease.  All contributors and participants in this course are members of the Charles Perkins Centre and will  speak from the unique interdisciplinary perspective that this Centre affords. \n\nThe course will describe a complex systems approach as the most productive way to ease the burden of chronic disease. It then describes  these diseases in detail, their risk factors, and the environmental and biological factors that have led to the  current epidemic of  obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Finally, the solutions – and more importantly the process for finding solutions- is the subject of the last module. No one approach by itself can ever be the answer, and certainly not a simple diet and exercise approach. \n\nThe entire course consists of 5 content modules, plus an extra module for completing assignments and discussions, and takes about 6 weeks to complete. Completion certificates are issued on the basis of participation in all 6 modules. \n\nWhat you'll learn: \n-\tHow the Charles Perkins Centre recruits interdisciplinary teams to ease the burden of chronic disease\n-\tHow a complex systems approach is necessary to provide solutions to a complex problem\n-\tThe fundamentals of chronic disease research and where it is heading\n-\tThe biggest risk factors for chronic disease and their global incidence\n-\tThe biological, genetic, social, regulatory, and other influences that have inflated these risk factors\n-\tHow to provide solutions globally for the reduction of chronic disease",

  "description" : "Every day you use your smartphone. Your smartphone wakes you up, it is the first thing you use in the morning, and the last thing you check (e.g., alarm setting) before you sleep. In addition, you use it all day. A typical cellphone user touches their mobile phone 2,617 times a day (Dscout report based on 2017) and people spend over 4 hours a day on their mobile phones (Hackernoon report) on average. Smartphones and smart watches are very useful and will become even more useful due to their smaller sizes, lighter weights, versatile functionalities, advanced mobile communications & wireless networking (e.g., Wi-Fi & Bluetooth) technologies. In this course, the start-of-the-art smartphone and smart watch technology and components in addition to the global market trends and future forecasts are introduced. Since everybody uses smartphones and smart watches, knowing the details about the most globally used electronic device will definitely help you in all aspects of new product and app design & development, as well as business planning. In addition, the core technology and components of the world’s most popular smartphones (i.e., the Samsung Galaxy Note8 and Apple iPhone X) and smart watches (i.e., Samsung Gear S3 and the Apple Watch Series 3) are introduced along with details of the iOS and Android smartphone OSs (Operating Systems) and mobile communications 1G to 5G (for details on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, please take my course “IoT Wireless & Cloud Emerging Technology”). This course ends with projects that teach how to analyze the components of smartphones and check the mobile network. Consequently, this course will prepare you to be more successful in businesses strategic planning in the upcoming smart device era. I cordially welcome you in to the amazing internal dynamics of the smart device world!",

  "description" : "Throughout the world, writing serves to express, record and even create meaningful moments. In academic spaces, writing becomes the bridge between ourselves and the world of ideas. In this course, we provide practical insights into how to write an academic essay. We show you how to develop the academic skills needed to be a  competent academic writer. You will have an opportunity to engage with texts written by academics, and to see how some of the ideas in these texts are used by students in constructing an academic essay. We address some of the challenges these students face with respect to academic writing and offer you the opportunity to practice and to develop your own writing style. For this course, we centre our lessons around a specific topic - the concept of identity, since it forms such an important feature of how we locate ourselves in an ever-changing global world. In other words, this course teaches academic writing skills through getting you to write and reflect on your understanding of identity. So if you are thinking about studying at a tertiary institution, or if you just want to brush up on your academic essay writing skills, this course is for you!",

This course will provide you with an introduction to the most recent research in the field of health effects of air pollution as well as a broader understanding of sources and spread of air pollution and what we should do about it.\n \nWhat is air pollution? What are the sources? How and where are we exposed outdoors and indoors? What happens in the body? Which diseases are the result? Who are the most vulnerable? How can we assess the effects of air pollution? And what should we do to reach the Sustainable Development Goal to “substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution”? These are some of the important questions we will address in the course.\n\nDuring the course you will meet researchers and experts from the University of Copenhagen and the Technical University of Denmark. They work with different aspects of air pollution and health: toxicology, exposure assessment, epidemiology, engineering and health impact assessment. It is a global responsibility to combat the health impacts of air pollution, and this fight can only be won through new knowledge and global collaboration. \n\nWe hope you will join us in the course and equip yourself to take part in this global and individual health challenge.",

Next, through a cognitively scaffolded process we'll engage you in developing your fluency with problem solving with nested if/else statements and compound conditionals in a way that keeps frustration at a minimum.  \n\nAlong the way you will learn about the common challenges or \"bugs\" students have with these concepts as well as ways to help them find and fix those concepts.  You'll also be guided in running classroom discussions to help students develop deeper understanding of these concepts.\n\nFinally, you'll prepare classroom resources to help your students to develop debugging skills.  Additionally, you will create resources to help educate your students about the impacts of lack of equity in K-12 CS instruction.",

  "description" : "Is your show accessible?\nWhen we ask about accessibility to shows, most people think about access for wheel chairs: the sitting arrangements and where their WC is accessible.\nWhen we ask for more details, people usually think about producing a show where persons with disabilities are performing, for example producing a show where there is some dancing with people on wheel chairs.\nAccessiblity for us is a comprehensive concept that goes from purchasing a ticket through an accessible website to catching the bus back home after the performance on accessible public transport. Accessible webs, accessible web content, accessible transport, subtitling, audio description... the possiblities are endless.\nWhy is this course useful? \nTo make the venue and the production accessible to all citizens, and specially to persons with disablities. The course will go through the many accessible services you can offer, and how to implement them in your venue or your production. The final aim is to mainstream accessibility so all people have equal access to culture.",

  "description" : "What is climate change ? How are mountain regions affected by the evolution of water resources and their uses ? What kind of risks need to be considered ? \n\nMountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base. \n\nIn this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.\n\nThis particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, République et Canton de Genève, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able :\n\n- to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions\n- to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies\n- to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions\n- to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health \n- to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.\n\nYour acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.\n\nThis MOOC on “Climate Change and Water in Mountain Regions : A Global Concern” was initiated and financed by the University of Geneva, through its Institute for Environmental Sciences. \n\nWe look forward to you joining us !",

  "description" : "Spatial (map) is considered as a core infrastructure of modern IT world, which is substantiated by business transactions of major IT companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, and Uber, and even motor companies such as Audi, BMW, and Mercedes. Consequently, they are bound to hire more and more spatial data scientists.  Based on such business trend, this course is designed to present a firm understanding of spatial data science to the learners, who would have a basic knowledge of data science and data analysis, and eventually to make their expertise differentiated from other nominal data scientists and data analysts.  Additionally, this course could make learners realize the value of spatial big data and the power of open source software's to deal with spatial data science problems.\n\nThis course will start with defining spatial data science and answering why spatial is special from three different perspectives - business, technology, and data in the first week.  In the second week, four disciplines related to spatial data science - GIS, DBMS, Data Analytics, and Big Data Systems, and the related open source software's - QGIS, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, R, and Hadoop tools are introduced together.  During the third, fourth, and fifth weeks, you will learn the four disciplines one by one from the principle to applications.  In the final week, five real world problems and the corresponding solutions are presented with step-by-step procedures in environment of open source software's.",

  "description" : "Economics, psychology, and neuroscience are converging today into a unified discipline of Neuroeconomics with the ultimate aim of creating a single, general theory of human decision-making. \n\nNeuroeconomics provides biologists, economists, psychologists and social scientists with a deeper understanding of how they make their own decisions and how others decide. Neuroscience, when allied with psychology and economics, creates powerful new models to explain why we make decisions. Neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making, decisions under risk, trust and cooperation will be central issues in this course. You will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques (fMRI, TMS, etc.) and introduced to the explanatory models behind them.\n\nThe course does not require any prior study of economics and neuroscience; however, it might require you to study novel interdisciplinary materials. The course provides an introduction to the methodology, assumptions, and main findings of  Neuroeconomics. Our students have different backgrounds; therefore, I have adapted and simplified the course to allow all students to understand the interdisciplinary content. This course will help you to start your progress in the field of Neuroeconomics and to further develop your skills during other more advanced courses and trainings in the future. For some topics, the course will also provide supplementary videos to reveal the opinions of leading experts in the field. Each module provides optional reading material.\n\nThe course structure is as follows: During each video, you will have to answer some relevant questions. Your answers will not affect your final grade. At the end of each module, you must complete a quiz consisting of 15 questions. To pass the course, you must reach a satisfactory standard in all the course modules by completing all graded quizzes and the final exam. In addition to watching video lectures and taking quizzes, you will receive an invitation to join our forum. We plan to join the discussions in the forum on a weekly basis.\n\nWelcome to Neuroeconomics World!\n\nDo you have technical problems? Write to us: coursera@hse.ru",

  "description" : "In this course you will be introduced to the basic ideas behind the qualitative research in social science. You will learn about data collection, description, analysis and interpretation in qualitative research. Qualitative research often involves an iterative process. We will focus on the ingredients required for this process: data collection and analysis.\nYou won't learn how to use qualitative methods by just watching video's, so we put much stress on collecting data through observation and interviewing and on analysing and interpreting the collected data in other assignments.\nObviously, the most important concepts in qualitative research will be discussed, just as we will discuss quality criteria, good practices, ethics, writing some methods of analysis, and mixing methods.\nWe hope to take away some prejudice, and enthuse many students for qualitative research.",

  "description" : "Welcome to the Inbound Certification course!\n\nThis course will introduce you to inbound and provide you with a big picture view of everything you need for a successful inbound strategy.\n\nSo, why inbound?\n\nInbound is a fundamental shift in the way you do business. Instead of an interruption-based message where the marketer or salesperson had all the control, inbound is about empowering potential customers. Consumer’s buying behaviors have changed and will continue to change. That's the driving force behind inbound. What your customers want today is different than what they wanted 10 years ago. That means you need to change the way you market, sell, and service to match the way people actually want to shop and buy.\n\nSo, wondering what to expect in this course?\n\nAfter an initial lesson on an introduction to the inbound fundamentals, the course consists of a set of lessons that follows the inbound methodology. The inbound methodology illustrates the four stages that make an inbound business. It reflects the entire inbound marketing, sales, services, and relationship process. The stages are Attract, Convert, Close, and Delight.\n\nEach lesson includes different tactics that you can apply to help you and your business grow better. You’ll also hear from HubSpot executives and leadership including: HubSpot’s Co-founders Brian Halligan & Dharmesh Shah. Chief People Officer, Katie Burke. VP of HubSpot Academy, Mark Kilens. VP of Marketing, Meghan Anderson. SVP of Product, Christopher O’Donnell. VP of Sales, Michelle Benfer. And VP of Customer Success, Alison Elworthy",
